                <p>
                    My dream job is to become a full-stack developer, but my personal prefernce is backend because I
                    lack creativity for frontend tasks. I also have interests in embbedded software and low level
                    languages.
                </p>
                <h2>What's your background?</h2>
                <p>
                    I started programming in 2020 during the pandemic, I started with JavaScript and HTML, the first
                    coding I did was making simple websites. Then I learned Pyton, Java, and Lua.
